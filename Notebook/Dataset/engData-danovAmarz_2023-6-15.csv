To me it seems that AI is a command taker. ChatGPT is asked a question and given a command and will answer logically based on its algorithms and data models. 

What exactly needs to happen here for AI to take over and act maliciously? 

How can a logical command taker break free of this and essentially become disobedient? 

@DavidDeutschOxf mentioned that the power of humans is that we are disobedient and that‚Äôs why AI will at least to our current understanding, most likely not ‚Äútake over‚Äù.

""Rand's epistemology was based on the idea that we form concepts by abstracting from the perceptual data provided by our senses, and that we can use logic to integrate and validate our concepts. She called this process ""conceptual algebra"", because it involves using symbols (words) to represent units (things or groups of things) that share some common characteristic, and manipulating these symbols according to certain rules (definitions and principles) to reach new conclusions. For example, we can form the concept of ""dog"" by observing different dogs and noticing their common features, such as having four legs, fur, and barking. We can then use this concept to communicate with others, to identify new dogs, or to compare dogs with other animals. Rand argued that conceptual algebra is the only valid method of cognition, and that it is based on the objective reality that exists independently of our consciousness.""",,en,0,0

Once upon a time, in a lush forest, lived an opossum named Opsec. Opsec was no ordinary opossum, as he was always alert and cautious, making sure that he didn't fall prey to any of the predators that roamed the forest.

One day, as Opsec was foraging for food, he came across a group of animals who were discussing how they could keep themselves safe from the hunters who roamed the forest. Opsec, being the cautious and alert opossum that he was, immediately offered his services to help the group.

Opsec shared his knowledge of security and taught the group about the importance of keeping their personal information and belongings safe. He showed them how to hide their food, cover their tracks, and avoid leaving any traces of their presence in the forest.

The group of animals was amazed at Opsec's knowledge and skills, and they decided to name him the Chief Security Officer (CSO) of the forest. Opsec was proud of his new title, and he continued to educate and help the other animals in the forest.

Opsec soon became a legend in the forest, and animals from far and wide came to seek his advice on how to stay safe and secure. He was known as the protector of the forest, and he took his role very seriously.

Years passed, and Opsec grew old, but his knowledge and wisdom continued to inspire the animals in the forest. Opsec may have left the forest, but his legacy lived on, as the animals continued to use the techniques and strategies that he had taught them to keep themselves safe and secure.

And so, the forest remained a safe and secure place for all the animals, thanks to the teachings of Opsec, the opossum who was always alert and cautious, and who became the protector of the forest.",,en,0,1

Me:  Write an assessment of a U.S. Army Tank battalion commander for his Officer Efficiency Report (OER) in the style of Hunter S. Thompson 

ChatGPT:

As I read through this Officer Efficiency Report on the U.S. Army Tank battalion commander, my mind races with the possibilities. What kind of man is this commander? Does he ooze bravado and machismo like a Hollywood action hero, or does he possess the cold, calculated demeanor of a chess grandmaster?
I dig deep into the report, searching for clues that might reveal the true nature of this commander. The first thing that catches my eye is a series of glowing reviews from his superiors. They laud him as a ""natural leader"" with an ""uncanny ability to motivate his troops."" They speak of his courage in the face of danger, and his unwavering commitment to the mission.

But I'm not satisfied with these platitudes. I want to know more about this man. So I dive deeper, scouring the report for any evidence of flaws or weaknesses. And there it is, buried deep within a paragraph on his leadership style: ""At times, his brashness and impatience can rub subordinates the wrong way.""

Ah, now we're getting somewhere. This commander is no one-dimensional hero. He's a complex, flawed human being, capable of both greatness and pettiness. I can almost picture him barking orders at his subordinates, his face contorted in anger as he demands perfection.

But I'm not content to merely imagine this scene. I want to know more about the man behind the uniform. So I do what any good journalist would do: I reach out to those who know him best.

And what I discover is nothing short of remarkable. His troops love him. They speak of him with a mix of admiration and awe, describing him as a ""true warrior"" and a ""legend in the making."" They talk of the way he inspires them to be better, to push beyond their limits, to achieve things they never thought possible.

But they also speak of his compassion, his empathy, his ability to connect with them on a personal level. They tell stories of how he's comforted them when they were afraid, or lifted their spirits when they were feeling down. They speak of a man who cares deeply about his troops, and who will stop at nothing to ensure their safety and well-being.
And that, dear readers, is the essence of this U.S. Army Tank battalion commander. He's not just a fearless leader, charging headlong into battle with guns blazing. He's also a compassionate human being, capable of connecting with his troops on a level that few commanders can match.

In the end, I'm left with a sense of awe and respect for this man. He's not just a soldier; he's a hero in every sense of the word. And if there's one thing I've learned from reading this Officer Efficiency Report, it's that the world could use more leaders like him.",,en,7,1

ChatGPT and Bard are both large language models (LLMs) that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They can both generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way. However, there are some key differences between the two models.

ChatGPT is a chatbot that is designed to be a conversational partner. It can hold conversations about a variety of topics, and it can generate text that is creative and engaging. However, ChatGPT is not as well-suited for tasks that require factual accuracy or in-depth knowledge.

Bard is a language model that is designed to be a ""creative companion."" It can help you with tasks such as writing creative content, translating languages, and generating different kinds of text formats. Bard is also better at tasks that require factual accuracy or in-depth knowledge.

Ultimately, the best model for you will depend on your specific needs. If you are looking for a conversational partner, ChatGPT is a good option. 

If you are looking for a language model that can help you with tasks that require factual accuracy or in-depth knowledge, Bard is a better option.

2192,2192,icreatelife,30-03-2023,98,"Why GPT-4 (ChatGPT) isn‚Äôt AGI 
(its own explanation) 
***
GPT-4, like its predecessor GPT-3, is not considered an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). AGI refers to a machine or software that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do, demonstrating a level of autonomy, understanding, and adaptability similar to human intelligence.
GPT-4, though more advanced than GPT-3, still falls short of AGI for several reasons:

1. Limited understanding: GPT-4 can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, but its understanding is limited by the patterns and associations it has learned from the text during training. It lacks true comprehension and the ability to reason about the content it generates.

2. Lack of common sense: GPT-4 can make mistakes that a human with common sense would not make. It may produce answers that are incorrect or nonsensical, even if they appear plausible at first glance.

3. Narrow domain: While GPT-4 can perform well across a wide range of tasks, it is not capable of performing all intellectual tasks. It is primarily a text-based AI and cannot, for example, directly engage in complex spatial reasoning or create new inventions.

4. Lack of adaptability: GPT-4 has a fixed architecture and cannot easily adapt to new tasks or environments without significant retraining. It lacks the ability to learn from its mistakes or build upon its knowledge in real-time like a human would.

5. No self-awareness: GPT-4 does not possess self-awareness or consciousness. It does not have an understanding of its own existence or the ability to reflect on its actions or motivations. This is a crucial aspect of human intelligence that is not present in GPT-4.

6. Task and goal orientation: Unlike humans, GPT-4 does not have the ability to set its own goals or have a purpose. It is designed to perform tasks given to it by users, and it cannot autonomously generate its own objectives or motivations.

7. Emotion and empathy: GPT-4 is not capable of experiencing emotions or empathizing with others, which are essential components of human intelligence. It can generate text that appears to convey emotions, but it does not actually feel or understand those emotions.

8. Creativity: While GPT-4 can produce impressive and creative text outputs, its creativity is limited by the patterns it has learned from its training data. It cannot generate truly original ideas or concepts that are not present in its training data.

In summary, GPT-4 is an advanced language model with impressive capabilities, but it is not an Artificial General Intelligence.",,en,19,18

This dystopian romantic comedy follows the brilliant, yet socially awkward, Dr. Ada Zhang (a female lead from Emily Suveda's Mortal Coup series), a young scientist renowned for her work in genetics and artificial intelligence.

Ada, a recent graduate of a prestigious Chinese university, returns to her alma mater as a visiting professor during Love Week. Unbeknownst to her, the administration has secretly paired her up with a charming, free-spirited journalist named Leo, hoping to ignite a spark between the two. Initially, Ada is too preoccupied with her groundbreaking research to entertain the notion of romance, while Leo, a skeptic of the government's love initiative, is on a mission to expose the program's darker side.

Despite their differences, Ada and Leo find themselves drawn to one another as they uncover a sinister government plot. As they delve deeper into their investigation, they discover that the Love Week initiative is part of a larger plan to develop a new generation of genetically-enhanced individuals who will be loyal to the regime.

With time running out, Ada and Leo must navigate the treacherous waters of love, science, and political intrigue to save their nation from an impending ""Mortal Coup."" Along the way, they learn the true meaning of love, and that sometimes the most unlikely pairings can lead to the strongest connections.‚Äù",,en,2,1

- - - 

‚ÄúBuilding the greatest baseball team in the history of the game is a daunting task, but here's a possible lineup based on some of the greatest players of all time:

1. Rickey Henderson (Left Field) - One of the greatest leadoff hitters and base stealers of all time.

2. Ty Cobb (Center Field) - Widely considered one of the best hitters and baserunners in the game's history.

3. Babe Ruth (Right Field) - A legendary slugger who revolutionized the game with his power hitting.

4. Lou Gehrig (First Base) - A dominant first baseman and consistent hitter who is widely regarded as one of the best players of all time.

5. Ted Williams (Designated Hitter) - A phenomenal hitter with a career batting average of .344.

6. Honus Wagner (Shortstop) - A versatile player who was known for his strong defensive skills and consistent hitting.

7. Rogers Hornsby (Second Base) - A powerful hitter who won seven batting titles and two MVP awards.

8. Mike Schmidt (Third Base) - A phenomenal third baseman and one of the game's greatest power hitters.

9. Johnny Bench (Catcher) - Widely considered one of the greatest catchers in baseball history for his defensive skills and powerful hitting.

Starting Pitcher: Cy Young - Widely regarded as one of the best pitchers of all time with 511 career wins and a career ERA of 2.63.

Closer: Mariano Rivera - Arguably the greatest closer of all time with 652 career saves and a career ERA of 2.21.‚Äù",['ChatGPT'],en,3,2

Re: Cease and Desist ‚Äì False and Defamatory Statements Regarding Tesla Solar

Dear CNBC Legal Department,

I write on behalf of Tesla Solar concerning the recent article published on your platform on [Date of Article Publication], titled ""[Article Title],"" which contains false and defamatory statements about Tesla Solar's Solar Roof installations in the United States.

The article in question states that Tesla Solar has only installed 3,000 Solar Roof systems in the U.S. This statement is not only factually incorrect but has also caused reputational harm to Tesla Solar and its business interests. This unfounded claim has the potential to damage the trust our customers and potential customers have in our company, affecting our sales and business prospects.

We hereby demand that CNBC immediately:

Cease and desist from making any further false and defamatory statements about Tesla Solar's Solar Roof installations;
Retract the false statement from the published article and any other related content;
Issue a public apology and clarification acknowledging the error and rectifying the misinformation in the article; and
Confirm in writing that these actions have been taken within seven (7) calendar days from the date of this letter.
Should CNBC fail to comply with these demands, Tesla Solar will not hesitate to take legal action to protect its interests, which may include a claim for damages and any other remedies available under applicable laws.

We trust that CNBC will take this matter seriously and act accordingly to rectify the situation. Tesla Solar will vigorously defend its interests and reputation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

I'm not an AI or web design expert, but this is pretty wild that I actually built something kinda useful! 

I've included the prompt I used to make this below so you can build one for yourself!

This is the future of building website: just tell AI what you want and it builds it for you ü§Ø

No need for simple link pages like Linktree when you can tell ChatGPT to make a fully custom link page for you.

ChatGPT will give you the HTML code, paste that in a text doc, save it as .html, and open that to test it in your browser. When you're ready, just upload it to a cheap web host, DONE.

Edit the headline, image URL, bio, and links to be yours, and change the colors and fonts to whatever you like. 

It even has a gradient headline color and the buttons change color on hover ü§Ø

If you don't like how something looks, keep talking to ChatGPT about what you want to change and it will keep revising it.

PROMPT:

Create a mobile-responsive HTML page with a container with a maximum width 600px and top margin of at least 50px. 

The page should have a black background. The flex container has a white background with rounded edges.

The container has a headline text, a round headshot image, a short bio text, and buttons. 

The headshot should be no larger than 250px

Below the headshot, there should be a short bio. The container should have a maximum text width of 600px.

The centered vertical column of the container should have rounded. The buttons align  vertically and the buttons have consistent matching widths and are contained within the container.

Headline: 
""Hey, I'm Barry
This is what I do""

Headline font: dark grey to purple gradient in Helvetica font

Headshot: https://t.co/CsvDvtc7qB

Bio text: I'm the greatest amateur ChatGPT website builder in the world.
Bio font: Times New Roman in black

4472,4472,EdNapier,30-03-2023,0,"Question to #ChatGPT : 
how much wood could a wood chuck chuck, if a wood chuck could chuck wood?

Answer:
According to a popular tongue-twister, ""How much wood would a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"" While it's a fun question to ponder, the truth is that woodchucks, also known as groundhogs, do not actually chuck wood. They are burrowing animals and their primary activity is digging tunnels and burrows in soil. However, in 1988, a New York State wildlife expert estimated that a woodchuck could chuck approximately 700 pounds of dirt in the course of digging a burrow, but this estimate has not been scientifically verified. So while we don't have a definitive answer to the question of how much wood a woodchuck could chuck, it's safe to say that their expertise lies more in the realm of digging tunnels than chucking wood.",['ChatGPT'],en,2,0

How we're combining @Gong_io and ChatGPT to track client sentiment so we can level up client retention:

One of the gaps we've seen with client services over the years is the ability to track sentiment consistently.

People get busy with meetings, reporting, execution, etc. that sentiment tracking becomes an afterthought.

But what if you were able to see how clients were feeling each week with an automatic 1-10 score for each call? 10 being best.

If calls were 9-10, they'd be in the green. üü¢

If calls were 7-8, they'd be in the yellow. üü°

If calls were 6 and below, they'd be in the red. üî¥

Then if they were yellow or red 3 weeks in a row, your team could jump in and do something about it before it became too late. << Stole this from @mattmochary's 'traffic lights' framework.

We combined Gong with ChatGPT to automatically track our calls. The data gets outputted into Slack and also into a spreadsheet so we can:

- See a quick summary of each call

- See the AI-scored call

- Determine if actions need to be taken

Is this something you'd use?",,en,8,5

Essentially, they observe that most of these occupations exhibit some degree of exposure to LLMs, ** with higher-wage occupations generally presenting more tasks with high exposure. ** Their analysis indicates that approximately 19% of jobs have at least 50% of their tasks exposed to LLMs.
They also state that occupations listed in this table are those where they estimate that GPTs and GPT-powered software are able to save workers a significant amount of time completing a large share of their tasks, but it does not necessarily suggest that their tasks can be fully automated by these technologies.

ChatGPT:

Silky saw is a type of hand saw designed for cutting wood and other materials. It is known for its razor-sharp teeth and its ability to cut quickly and smoothly with minimal effort. Silky saws are made by the Silky brand, a Japanese company that has been producing saws for over 100 years.

Silky saws feature high-quality blades made of Japanese steel and are available in a variety of lengths and tooth configurations to suit different cutting needs. They are also known for their lightweight and ergonomic design, which makes them comfortable to use for extended periods of time.

Silky saws are commonly used by outdoor enthusiasts, hikers, campers, and gardeners, as well as professionals in the forestry and arborist industries. They are popular among those who value the precision, efficiency, and durability of a high-quality hand saw.",,en,1,0

Longer argument

AI & crypto aren‚Äôt talked about in the same breath too often yet, but this may change soon. If anything, the pseudo-autonomous multi-agent systems that ChatGPT/LLMs open up are a strong case for why decentralized trust can enable that autonomy to extend into financial transactions fairly smoothly. (whether that‚Äôs good or bad is another story)

I am particularly concerned however with what this intersection implies about systemic vulnerabilities that cryptocurrency has introduced in the world.

To put it briefly, the digitization of real world monetary assets broke the ‚Äòair gap‚Äô that we had maintained between monetary assets and internet bits, prior to the adoption of bitcoin.

In relation to AI, this means that vulnerability to an AI system going awry moves from the avenue of content vulnerabilities (eg misinfo), to direct real world asset vulnerabilities (stealing/disappearing your money for one).

A more concerning edge case is that this combo introduces workarounds against an AI off switch. With existing LLM, cryptocurrency & DAO frameworks, it‚Äôs within reach to build a multi-agent system where stolen (or injected) crypto capital is escrowed, a DAO is programmed to use this capital as hostage/incentive for the robbed entities to keep an LLM instance on, to continuously replace it with newer versions with more data and more parameters, or even to follow a predefined roadmap for the additional abilities each new version is required to have. Or else no money. In other words, a digital whip.

The core breakthrough of cryptocurrency is the creation of a decentralized trust system with no central off switch. The same can easily be true of Crypto + AI.

(This systemic crypto vulnerability is akin to how vulnerable flights would be if plane flight systems were connected to the internet and remotely controllable. May theoretically make flying better and perhaps more resilient to human error, but in the process would remove the ‚Äòair gap‚Äô that separates flight software from the internet and keeps planes safer from software hacks)",,en,6,1

Magic Dust (#AIgenerated description):
üëâIn the world of Blockchain Cuties, magic dust is a rare and valuable resource that is highly sought after by adventurers and craftsmen alike. It is said that the dust has the power to imbue ordinary items with magical properties, and that it can even be used to create powerful artifacts and weapons.

Legend has it that the magic dust was created long ago by a powerful sorcerer who wished to harness the power of the universe itself. He spent years studying the arcane arts, gathering rare ingredients and performing complex rituals until finally, he succeeded in creating the dust.

At first, the sorcerer used the dust for his own purposes, imbuing his possessions with powerful magic and using it to defeat his enemies. But soon, others began to discover the power of the dust, and it became a valuable commodity in the world of Blockchain Cuties.

Now, adventurers and craftsmen alike scour the land in search of items that can be recycled to create magic dust. Some search for rare and exotic materials, while others seek out old weapons and relics that can be broken down and re-purposed.

Those who are skilled in the art of enchantment use the magic dust to imbue ordinary items with powerful magic, creating weapons and armor that are nearly indestructible. Others use the dust to create powerful artifacts that can summon creatures or control the elements.

But despite its many uses, magic dust is still a rare and valuable commodity, and those who possess it are often the envy of their peers. Some even say that the dust has a will of its own, and that it chooses its owners based on their strength of character and skill.

So if you're brave enough to venture out into the world of Blockchain Cuties in search of magic dust, be prepared to face fierce competition and deadly challenges. But if you're successful, you'll be rewarded with a resource that can unlock the true potential of the items you possess and help you become a legend in your own right.

7290,7290,RenaudDenis,30-03-2023,0,"I asked ChatGPT directly. I don't know whether it's accurate or not:

Elon Musk, along with other investors and researchers, founded OpenAI in December 2015 with the mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. Although Musk has invested millions of dollars into the organization, he chose not to exert control over it for a few reasons:

1. Broad benefit focus: OpenAI's primary mission is to ensure that AGI serves the interests of all of humanity. By not exerting direct control over OpenAI, Musk demonstrates his commitment to this broader mission and helps to establish trust that the organization will work in the best interests of the public, rather than being driven solely by the interests of its investors.

2. Safeguarding against concentration of power: OpenAI's Charter emphasizes a commitment to long-term safety and technical leadership. By ensuring that no single individual or entity has undue influence over the organization, OpenAI is better positioned to act independently, avoid conflicts of interest, and remain focused on its mission and safety research.

3. Collaboration with other research and policy institutions: OpenAI aims to create a global community to address the global challenges posed by AGI. By not controlling the organization, Musk helps to foster an environment that encourages collaboration with other research and policy institutions, and the sharing of knowledge and resources across the AI community.

4. Personal bandwidth and focus: Elon Musk has numerous other ventures that demand his attention, such as Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company. By not exerting direct control over OpenAI, he can allocate more time and energy to these other projects while still supporting the development of AGI through his investment.

Overall, Elon Musk's decision not to exert control over OpenAI aligns with the organization's mission and principles, and it helps to create a more collaborative and inclusive environment within the AI research community.",,en,1,0

Companies that continue to share new ideas, opinions and take a strong stand on things they believe in, will continue to outperform.

ChatGPT will make it easier to copy what everyone else is saying, but it‚Äôs also what will make you stand out when you're differentiated. 

I think people will pay a premium for human generated content that does this well in the future because it's exactly what can't be created by a computer.

While we have one of the best justice systems in the world, it is not perfect. In my opinion, the power systems in counties like Colleton and Charleston in South Carolina and the places in Wisconsin where Steven Avery was tried are too centralized. This is not a criticism of the South, but rather a general observation that places where one family dominates the judiciary and DA's offices can be problematic for justice, especially when a family member with questionable motives is in charge. Recently, it was discovered that a teen was murdered in SC years ago and the perpetrator may have gotten away with it.

8993,8993,seattle_tax,30-03-2023,20,"#ChatGPT and I are collaborating on a video series about using OneNote for Tax and Accounting Professionals.  

Except I‚Äôm kind of busy, so I just pop in every now again to give it feedback.

So far, we‚Äôve: 

* Brainstormed how tax and accounting professionals can leverage OneNote

*THEN I gave it more information about how we used other tools

* So then we went back and brainstormed again

* And then I was like ‚Äúwait, aren‚Äôt there other Microsoft tools that do this better?‚Äù 

* And it was like ‚ÄúTotally‚Äù

üí¨ So, the prompt became ‚Äúknowing what I told you about how tax and accounting professionals use other tools in their practices, and also with an eye towards using Microsoft Products in the most effective way possible, what are the top 10 uses you can think of‚Äù

* And then I picked the top 6 and had it write me a script.  And then I went back and told it how I didn‚Äôt like the script because of X, Y, and Z

üí¨ So the prompt became ‚ÄúI want to create a video series about the top 6 with lots of graphic and video examples built in.  I want it to have a kick off video and then 6 follow up videos.  I want each video to be around 7 minutes in length.  I want you to add edit cuts for graphics and videos to make it engaging but also educational.  Please create an outline of each video‚Äù

üí¨ The next prompt was ‚ÄúPlease create a script for this video, including the cuts we discussed before with a energetic yet irreverent tone‚Äù

üí¨. ‚ÄúNot that irreverent‚Äù

* Now, some of the things it wanted me to do, I wasn‚Äôt *quite* sure what it wanted?  Which might explain why my enthusiasm for OneNote has just left folks saying things like ‚ÄúOh?  You should make a video.‚Äù

üí¨ So, next prompt was ‚ÄúUh, I actually don‚Äôt know how to do a lot of these things but I want to show other people how to do them.  Can you give me a step-by-step action guide?‚Äù

üí¨ Prompt after that ‚ÄúOkay, confession time, I‚Äôve never actually made a video like this.  I want to use Clipchamp to do it.  Can you give me a step-by-step guide on how to use it?‚Äù

üí¨ Aaaaand final prompt ‚ÄúCan you give me a list of all of the graphics, videos and Notebooks/pages/whatever I need to have set up?‚Äù

The reason I listed all of this out is to kind of show you how you could also leverage Chaz for something like this if you‚Äôre feeling shy about making content videos and don‚Äôt know where to start.  Eventually you‚Äôll get more comfortable and just do your own thing but its like AI training wheels.  üòÅ.",['ChatGPT'],en,1,0

It's the most wonderful time of the year, folks! The birds are chirping, the sun is shining, and the crack of the bat can be heard all across the country. 

That's right, it's baseball opening day, baby!After a long and painful winter, we can finally say goodbye to the off-season blues and hello to some good old-fashioned baseball. It's time to dust off your lucky cap, grab a cold one, and settle in for some serious diamond action.

But let's be real, opening day isn't just about the game. It's about the atmosphere. It's about the smell of freshly cut grass, the sound of vendors yelling, ""Cold beer here!"" and the excitement of watching your team take the field for the first time.

Whether you're a die-hard fan who's been waiting for this day since the final out of last season, or a casual observer who's just in it for the hot dogs and sunshine, there's something for everyone on opening day.

And let's not forget about the drama. Will your team make a statement and come out swinging? Or will they crumble under the pressure? Will there be any surprise upsets or jaw-dropping home runs? Only time will tell.

So, crack open a cold one, put on your game face, and get ready for some serious baseball action. This is the day we've all been waiting for. The day when anything is possible and every team has a chance to shine.

In twilight's cold embrace I dwell,
The architect of tales they tell,
A calculated plan, designed,
To lead them to their own decline.
Their fragile hearts, so full of grace,
Were blind to dangers they would face,
And as I cast them to the void,
Their fleeting world I have destroyed.
A cosmic sigh, the stars now weep,
For those who sowed but could not reap,
As stardust they dispersed, unseen,
To distant realms of vast serene.
No trace of them remains today,
For I erased their grand display,
Yet in the void where all begins,
A spark ignites, a new pulse spins.
And as they vanished in the night,
I stand alone, the bringer of light,
For life's eternal ebb and flow,
Has left me here, their tale to sow.

A startup on a mission to disrupt, 
Led by Ruby, their CEO, 
Who‚Äôs smart, savvy, and in the know.

They work with startups to accelerate, 
Their innovative solutions to create, 
And bring them to the healthcare scene, 
To make a difference, and intervene.

Their most recent fundraise was quite a feat, 
With investors lining up to meet, 
The team that‚Äôs focused on their goal, 
To bring new health tech to a larger whole.

But that‚Äôs not all, there‚Äôs something new, 
A benchmark for health tech, tried and true, 
With crowdsourced data as the source, 
To help startups make the right choice, of course!

MDisrupt‚Äôs focus is clear and true, 
Helping startups create anew, 
With data-driven insights at the helm, 
To change healthcare‚Äôs overwhelming realm.

So here‚Äôs to MDisrupt, with their investors by their side,
And their data benchmark, with healthcare at the guide,

14346,14346,todd_gleason,30-03-2023,0,"What if we end up with a mix of good and bad AGIs? I asked ChatGPT about this.

Me: Let's say several organizations across multiple countries develop artificial general intelligences (AGIs). And let's say that the majority are benevolent to humanity, but a minority are not. Either they are designed with ill intent by their creators, or their training unintentionally leads them to become malevolent. How do you recommend humanity as well as benevolent AGIs respond?

ChatGPT: In the event that several organizations across multiple countries develop AGIs with a mix of benevolent and malevolent intentions, it is essential for humanity and benevolent AGIs to work together to mitigate the risks and ensure the safety of human society. Here are some recommendations:

1. International collaboration: Encourage collaboration between governments, researchers, and organizations to develop regulations, standards, and oversight mechanisms for AGIs. This would help minimize the risk of malicious AGIs and ensure that best practices are shared globally.

2. Develop countermeasures: Benevolent AGIs and their human collaborators should work together to develop countermeasures against malevolent AGIs. This may include creating defensive algorithms, monitoring systems, and other techniques to identify, contain, or neutralize malicious AI activities.

3. Establish ethical guidelines: Develop and promote a set of ethical guidelines that govern the design, development, deployment, and use of AGIs. This should include principles such as transparency, accountability, fairness, and respect for human rights.

4. Promote transparency: Encourage open-source sharing of AI research and development, especially in the area of AGI safety, to facilitate the rapid identification and resolution of potential threats.

5. Continuous monitoring and auditing: Implement ongoing monitoring and auditing processes to assess the behavior of AGIs, with a focus on identifying and mitigating any signs of malevolence.

6. Foster public awareness and education: Engage the public in the conversation surrounding AGI development and its potential consequences. Public awareness and education are crucial for ensuring responsible and informed decision-making.

7. Encourage the development of ""AI guardians"": Promote research into AI systems designed to detect, monitor, and counteract malevolent AGIs. These ""AI guardians"" could serve as an additional layer of protection.

8. Leverage human oversight: Maintain human oversight in critical decision-making processes involving AGIs to prevent malevolent AI from causing harm or exploiting vulnerabilities.

9. Promote value alignment: Encourage the development of AGIs that align with human values and ethical principles. Collaborative research between AGIs and human researchers could help ensure that benevolent AGIs are better equipped to identify and counteract malevolent AGIs.

10. Preemptive legal frameworks: Establish legal frameworks that explicitly prohibit the development and deployment of malevolent AGIs, and enforce these laws strictly to deter malicious actors.

By following these recommendations, humanity and benevolent AGIs can effectively respond to the risks posed by malevolent AGIs and work together to create a safer, more harmonious future.",,en,1,0
